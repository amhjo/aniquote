This is just a little evening project I did to learn how to work with APIs. It works on deskop, tablets as well as mobile. It uses [Animechan](https://animechan.vercel.app/), a really fun API that sends you randomizes anime quotes.
Please go check it out and give the creator some love!

This project was inspired by Florin Pop's super easy tutorial on Fetch APIs, please check it out and support him [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f2HNadULOs).
